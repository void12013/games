            	<p>Roblox Bedwars is a fighting game to play you have a bed and you if an enemy breaks it then you cant respawn but you can defend it you can buy blocks with iron from a generator near your base to buy block. Some blocks are more exspensive because they are harder to break. Iron also lets you buy armor and weapons and stuff like fireballs. and gloops which slow the player them for a little bit. Theres is something called the forge you need forgery points to use it you can get forgery point after some time or killing enemys but you get the most from breaking beds without forgery pionts you cant get diomond gear and you do less damege and you get les health cause you cant upgrade your armor and let you get more different types of wepons like the dagger wich alows you teleport to the enemy every 5 to 10 seconds but only a few blocks and the scyte so if you charge it up it makes you go furter and when fighting enemys it makes you hit them and makes them miss once and then you have to charge it up again and the charge time takes about 5 seconds. And lastly the hammer it hits slower but does the most damege and if you charge it up it swings really hard doing a bunch of knockback. With blocks you can go to diamonds with diamonds you can up grade stuff like damage, armor ,break speed, diamond generator and iron generator there are diamond gardians that if you kill you get more diamonds. Diamond generator allows diamonds to spawn in your iron generator and the first time you up grade it you get one diamond every 30 seconds. Second upgrade you get a diamond every 20 seconds and the last upgrade you get one every 15 seconds. iron generator makes iron come faster with the first upgrade the second makes iron come faster and the last one makes adds emeralds. Emeralds let you buy the best gear that you can get and you can get stuff like telepearls which if you throw wherever it lands you get teleported there you can find emeralds at the center of the map. The titan is a boss that has a lot of health but if you kill it you do more damage for some time the titan spawns in the middle of the map. Theres one map whereyou can get gold with gold you can buy treasure chests that if you open you get random loot theres health oranges that if you eat you regen health faster and exsposive barrels that anybody hits with there sword it expodes. Diamonds also can repair the enchant table which if you have 80 iron you can get an enchant like fire 1 or life steal 1 or if you have 3 emeralds you can get a more powerful enchant like fire 3 or static 3. If you kill an enemy you get there loot like if they had emeralds you get or iron and diamonds. so if they were trying to get diamond armor and you killed them you get the loot. Theres something called kits. kits help give you buffs like bounty hunter so they give you a target and if you kill the target you not only get loot your enemy had but you also get extra loot theres yuzi which you get a speacial sword that if you charge it up it makes you further and does extra damage to enemys. You can buy kits for 400 Robux you can buy bundles for 800 Robux. You can buy the battlepass for 800 Robux the battle pass gives you emotes and kits if you want all the kits in the battlepass you have to get level 50 you can get levels by getting xp from playing or you can buy 50 levels with 15000 Robux. There are different modes like luckey block which have custom stuff that you wont get in any other gamemode. Then theres skywars that the goal of is to get loot from chests like armor, wepons, fireballs and telepearls the best loot is in the chests in the middle. there is ranked so you first have to play 5 placment matches to see what rank you are in after that if you win a ranked match you get ranked points if you lose a match you lose ranked points. Ranked points help you get a higher rank the highest rank is nightmare rank. You can make partys that any body in youre party will be on your team no matter what. You can also make custom mathes where you can chose the map and make any gamemode you want. if youre the owner of the party you can use host panel which allows you to get any item in the game that has ever been created you can also set how much health you have, make all the generators faster and make someone else cohost but you dont get any xp you can use it to practice maybe. Bedwars gives free kits to use every week and they also update every week on friday. And thats how to play bedwars thanks for reading.</p>

            	<p>If you're looking to increase your skill level in Arsenal, then I've got a bunch of tips and tricks on how you can get better! I've played a lot of FPS games in the past, so I picked up Arsenal pretty quick. However, if this is one of your first shooter games, then you might not know some of the fundamentals on surviving and getting eliminations! These strategies should have you increasing your placements, and maybe even winning yourself some games! Here's a look at a bunch of tips and tricks that I use each time I play the game. Change Your Crosshair Color
                You can do this in the Settings area of Arsenal under Display. Pick a color that doesn't show up often on any of the maps. I, for instance, use a bright pink crosshair, because this shows up well on all backgrounds. In other games I've seen people opt for a bright green that stands out pretty well. The whole point of this is just making sure it never blends into the background so you can see it clearly at all times. This just helps you know where you're firing at when you are shooting. One of the most important aspects to winning in Arsenal is understanding that most assisted eliminations count just as much as a solo one does. So, if you do 5 damage to a player and your teammate finishes them off, then you will still change your weapon. That's important because that means we need to hit people with just the slightest bit of damage to get credit. We're looking to cycle through guns as fast as possible, so if you're with a teammate or two, just make sure you get a bit of damage on the enemy and it should count towards your level! Cover is anything that gets in the way of your enemy's gunfire getting at you! So, that could be a box, car, wall, or anything else that you can keep in front of you that will block bullets. Use this when you're reloading or if you have a weapon that fires slowly. Only show yourself when you're ready to fire at them, because anytime you are out in the open and can't shoot you are just a defenseless target! The high ground is incredibly important in shooting games! This is because when you fire down at an opponent, they can only target part of you where you can target all of them. You are partially blocked by the surface you are on, so it makes it harder for them to shoot you. If it's quickly and safely available, you should always try to get higher than your opponent. I say safely because if you are on a ladder, then you are an easy target if an enemy is around.
                Another reason to use high ground is because it's the best for sneaking up on an enemy. You can use this to more easily get a melee or golden melee elimination. Try to jump behind your foe and sneak up on them with your melee weapon! A big key to surviving after a fight is to pick up the green bottle that drops from the enemy you took out! This will heal you up some and get you back into fighting shape. I have noticed the health doesn't always pick up when I walk over it, so you have to really make sure to kind of pause on it to make sure it picks up! It's important to have a general sense of how weapons work. Here's a quick overview of the types of weapons you'll come across and how best to use them. In most FPS games, Pistols are usually pretty weak because they don't do great damage and they aren't that good from far away. However, in Arsenal they appear to do just as much damage from distance as they do up close. That's pretty significant and makes them not too bad to use. The key with pistols is to largely try to just aim for headshots and slow down your shots. Try to peak out just barely from cover and snap off a quick shot when possible. If they are just running towards you then that's when you can just fire like crazy at them. Shotguns generally fire a spread of bullets and are usually much weaker at long range. So, try to avoid shooting at players that are far away when you have a shotgun (unless you just need to get damage on someone). You will want to try and close the distance between you and the player if they are at a distance. So, try to run between cover to get to them and avoid getting shot. Once you're close enough, try to make sure the full amount of your bullets hits the player when you fire! There's a lot of different rifles in this game and they can shoot quite quickly. These are likely the easiest weapons to use because you can just hold down the fire button and aim it towards someone and it should take them out. Try to just keep your aim under control because your crosshairs will jump around a bit when firing! Anything with a scope and the loss of your crosshair we'll call a Sniper Rifle in Arsenal. You pretty much want to try and stay far away from the enemy and use the scope to hit them with your shots. You won't always have this luxury though, so if they are close don't bother scoping and just try to fire at them using the middle of your screen as your crosshair. This is something you learn with experience, try to get a sense of where you think your crosshair should be and fire based on that. These are really fun and powerful in Arsenal. This is stuff like Rocket Launchers and Concussion Rifles. One of the best things you can do with these is jump up and shoot the ground beneath you. This will propel you upwards and you can either fire down at your enemy from the sky or land on a roof. Most players will not expect people to do this so you can generally get some easy eliminations this way. It can take some practice, but try it out next time and see what you can do! Things like pizza, baseballs, ninja stars, and all other sorts of weird weapons. The majority of these are "projectile" weapons. That just means they don't travel instantly to their target and they will eventually lose velocity and head into the ground. So, try to get close to people when you're using these, and if you're far away you need to aim higher so it reaches the target. You want to take advantage of melee as much as possible, because if you can get a melee finish on someone they go back a level and you gain a level! Try to use high ground if possible and jump down behind a player. If you can melee them in the back, it will be an instant elimination. Avoid any melee 1-on-1 battles because you don't want to lose a level. A lot of weapons make you run a quite a bit slower than normal, so to alleviate this you should run with your melee weapon out if there are no nearby enemies. This is a bit dangerous, but if you're going for wins you need to get eliminations as fast as possible, so you can't be walking around slow with a large weapon out. I try to take out my weapon only when I think someone is going to be coming around a corner or I'm going to be peeking around a corner. I play the game on a computer, so I have some additional tricks that will only be relevant for PC players. One of the most important things that will help yous tart aiming better in shooter games is lowering your sensitivity on the mouse. Most esports players play with a low sensitivity, so you should lower your DPI settings on your mouse if you have that option. I run at 800 DPI as an example. I also have my Camera Sensitivity in Roblox particularly low, it is currently set at 0.20015 on my PC. You can play with your numbers and see what feels comfortable for you. It will feel pretty slow at first, but you will get used to it and it should increase your accuracy! Thanks for reading!</p>
